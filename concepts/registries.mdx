title: Registries

Registries are used to manage collections of modules & share modules across backends.  All modules belong to a registry.

## Common practices

Most mature game studios have registries configured like this inside of their game's repo:

```yaml backend.yaml
registries:
  # Modules shared across multiple games
  shared:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/my-studio/my-registry.git
      directory: ./modules
  # Modules specific to this game
  local:
    local:
      directory: ./modules
modules:
  module_a: {}  # Pulls from the default registry
  module_b:
    registry: shared
  module_c:
    registry: local
```

## Special registries

### `default`

The registry named `default` is special. Any modules without a specified registry will be fetched from the default registry.

The default config for the `default` registry is:

```yaml backend.yaml
registries:
  default:
    git:
      url:
        https: https://github.com/rivet-gg/opengb-registry.git
        ssh: git@github.com:rivet-gg/opengb-registry.git
      directory: ./modules
      rev: foobar
```

You can override this in your `backend.yaml` file.

### `local`

The registry named `local` is special. All commands with `opengb create` will create a module in the `local` registry.

Most projects specify a default registry like:

```yaml backend.yaml
registries:
  local:
    local:
      directory: ./modules
```

## Types of registries

### `local`

Local registires represent a directory on your local filesystem holding modules. This is useful for custom modules that won't be shared with other backends or for testing.

If a module is stored locally but shared across multiple backends, set `isExternal` to true.

`local` modules are included by default in tests & generate migrations, unless `isExternal` is specified.

Example:

```yaml backend.yaml
registries:
  local:
    local:
      directory: ./modules
      isExternal: true  # Optional
```

### `git`

Git registries represent a git repository holding modules. This is useful for sharing modules across multiple backends.

This uses the native Git CLI to fetch modules, so you can use private Git registries that your computer has access to.

```yaml backend.yaml
registries:
  shared:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/my-studio/my-registry.git
      directory: ./modules
```
