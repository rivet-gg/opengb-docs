## What you'll learn

We're going to build a simple leaderboard module from scratch.

We're going to:

- Create a module
- Setup your database
- Write scripts
- Write a test

Make sure you've installed Open Game Backend as described [here](/concepts/install).

## Step 1: Create project

Create a new directory. Open a terminal in this directory.

Run the following command:

```sh
opengb init
```

This will create a `backend.yaml` file in your directory with some default settings.

## Step 2: Create module

Run:

```sh
opengb create module my_leaderboard
```

This will create a directory `modules/my_leaderboard` and updated `backend.yaml` to include the module. The important files we'll look at are `modules/my_leaderboard/db/schema.prisma`, `modules/my_leaderboard/scripts/`, and `modules/my_leaderboard/tests/`.

## Step 3: Setup database

```prisma

```
